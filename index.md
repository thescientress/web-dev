## Why æternity
If you are already familiar with basic blockchain principles and smart contracts, start with learning
about æternity’s unique features. The æternity protocol ships with a rich set of features
and functionality out of the box.

A full specification and documentation of the protocol can be found on GitHub

                        The æternity protocol can do everything that you expect from a Smart Contract
                        Blockchain platform like Ethereum or others. It can be used to power <b>Games, Payments,
                        Identity, Decentralized Finance, Registries, Token-Economy, Logistics and more.</b> Some of
                        the things are not yet invented that will be built with æternity. <strong>The future
                        is yours.</strong>

                    <p>
                        &AElig;eternity is built with security in mind. The reference implementation is written in
                        Erlang, following all standards of high-quality software engineering. Recurring security
                        audits and intensive property based testing are part of the daily work of the protocol
                        developers. In its security aspects on blockchain, the æternity protocol gets shipped
                        with a type safe virtual machine called FATE (Fast Aeternity Transaction Engine) which was
                        engineered to boost efficiency (gas consumption) and security (type safe). Together with
                        Sophia, a functional smart contract language that supports formal verification, the æternity
                        protocol provides an unique take on blockchain and smart contract security. A highly paid
                        bug bounty program is available for security researchers.

                    <h3>Scalable</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to scale to billions of users and transactions the æternity protocol provides
                        trustless scaling through off-chain state channels. Without compromising on security state
                        channels allow peer to peer transaction between users and the execution of smart contracts
                        off-chain. This way æternity has no limits in scaling. The network consensus of the
                        protocol is fast. In average up to 15 times faster with a higher transaction throughput then
                        comparable protocols. The confirmation time is as less as three seconds, which especially
                        comes into account when looking at user experience.

                    <h3>Efficient low-to-no fees</h3>
                    <p>
                        æternity is equipped with dozens of unique native transactions types for State
                        Channels, Oracles, Names among others. All functionality is optimized to work with minimal
                        gas cost. Additionally, once established, within off-chain State Channels, there are no fees
                        for transactions or smart contract executions. On-chain, with Bitcoin-NG, the consensus
                        mechanism of the protocol allows for more transactions and gas (smart contract executions)
                        per block. This relaxes the fee and gas market and leads to lower cost. Combined with the
                        execution of smart contracts through the highly efficient FATE VM, less overall Gas is
                        needed. Additionally with off-chain State Channels, the æternity protocol reduces the
                        on-chain transaction and smart contract execution volumes massively, which lowers the fees.

                    <h3>Interoperable Oracles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Oracles are a special type of transactions on æternity to request and provide data
                        from data providers and APIs. If a smart contract for example is in need of today's weather
                        data, a oracle request transaction including a data schema can be broadcasted on chain. Data
                        providers can respond to data and charge a fee for providing the response. The other way
                        around oracle provides can register on-chain and provide all types of data for free or by
                        charging a fee. This allows smart contract developers to interact and build upon all sorts
                        of APIs and create applications which are dependent on outside data (for example the current
                        price of Bitcoin at a certain time).

                    <p>
                        With Satoshi’s heritage in its core (Nakamoto Consensus) the protocol is build to be
                        decentralized. Everyone can host a node and start mining, connect to the network and help to
                        secure the chain or verify transaction. The network is operated by an community of thousands
                        of nodes. It is fully trustless, there is no central authority, no master nodes or
                        kill-switches. With Cuckoo Circle, æternity has chosen a highly efficient
                        proof-of-work algorithm which is the first graph-theoretic proof-of-work, and the most
                        memory bound, yet with instant verification.

                    <h3>Public and Private</h3>
                    <p>
                        The æternity protocol is using the accounts model. All transactions are public by
                        default. Aeternity allows a very flexible and open design of accounts, which is called
                        Generalized Accounts that enable signing transactions with a high flexibility.
                        Cryptographically the protocol uses Blake2b (256 bits digest) and ed25519. It supports
                        Schnorr Signatures. The communication between nodes is encrypted with the noise protocol.
                        Off-chain State Channel transactions and smart contract executions are fully private unless
                        published on-chain for dispute resolution. It is easy to setup a private blockchain network
                        (example for Enterprise or Public Institutions).

                        A built-in Naming System for human readable names allows you to point names to accounts and
                        contracts (Example: ak_XbqHD3RYPb3w3eVopLyc... becomes yourname.chain). This makes
                        transacting tokens between peers easiest and can help to make smart contract code more
                        readable and upgradable.

                        signaling node operators can show their support for hard upgrades. All token holders can
                        join a weighted delegated polling mechanism through an mobile and user friendly app with
                        verifiable results on the æternity blockchain. Discussions are taking place in chat
                        rooms, online forums, public events and in the aexpansions repository on GitHub.

                not present in Sophia, and some blockchain specific primitives, constructions and types have been
                added.

            If you are new to æternity and want to try out the Sophia Smart Contract Language, is is suggested
            to use one of the community developed online IDE’s. They allow you to write contracts, compile them,
            post them to the chain on testnet and call its functions.

                    &AElig;project is an æternity framework which helps with setting up a project. The
                    framework makes the development of smart contracts in the æternity network pretty easy. It
                    provides commands for compilation, deployment of smart contracts, running a local node, local
                    compiler and unit testing the contracts.
