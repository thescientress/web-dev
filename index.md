# Welcome Developer,<br>Node Operator and Miner
This page helps you to get started with æternity.

<Section id="why">

## The æternity Blockchain is open source, public and permissionless
If you are already familiar with basic blockchain principles and smart contracts, start with learning
about æternity’s unique features. The æternity protocol ships with a rich set of features
and functionality out of the box.

A full specification and documentation of the protocol can be found in the documentation hub and in the white paper. The source code and latest releases of the æternity node are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity).

## Safe smart contract development with Sophia
Sophia is a language in the ML family. It is a strongly typed and has a restricted mutable state. Sophia is a functional Ocaml like language which syntax most resembles that of Reason.

### What is Sophia?
![](./img/Sophia_Icon.svg) Sophia is customized for smart contracts, which can be published to a blockchain (the æternity blockchain). Thus some features of conventional languages, such as floating point arithmetics, are not present in Sophia, and some blockchain specific primitives, constructions and types have been added.

## Developer tools
Programming libraries are available. Any Javascript developer can build a simple æternity app in one day. For a quick start and reference SDK it is recommended to use the JavaScript one.

  ### SDK Frontend APIs
  - [JavaScript](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js) (recommended)
  - [Python](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-python)
  - [Go](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-go)
  - [Java](https://github.com/kryptokrauts/aepp-sdk-java) (Community Maintained)
  - [Elixir SDK](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-elixir)
- ![](./img/Aeternal_icon.svg)
  ### æternal Backend API

  The [æternal](https://github.com/aeternity/aeternal) is a caching and reporting layer which sits in front of the nodes of the æternity blockchain. Its purpose is to respond to queries faster than the node can do, and to support queries that for reasons of efficiency the node cannot or will not support itself.
- ![](./img/Terminal_icon.svg)
  ### CLI - Command Line Client

  Quickly test all of Aeternity’s blockchain features from your Terminal, you can Install and use our [NodeJS CLI](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-cli-js).

## Useful resources

::: slot cards

- ### Hosted API Server, Public Nodes and Services
  For convenience reasons, there are hosted services available to quick start the development of æternity blockchain applications on testnet. Even though all services are available for mainnet too, it is not advised to use these services in production. Therefore self-hosting critical infrastructure is recommended.
  - Testnet æternal API Server [https://testnet.aeternal.io](https://testnet.aeternal.io)
  - Testnet API Gateway Nodes hosted on [https://testnet.aeternity.io/api](https://testnet.aeternity.io/api)
