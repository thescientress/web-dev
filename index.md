## Why æternity is so innovative?
æternity blockchain is an Erlang-based scalable smart contract platform engineered by programming pioneers to address some of the most fundamental challenges native to earlier blockchains. 
By redesigning blockchain technology at the protocol level, the æternity developer community has enabled the core protocol to understand and integrate a rich set of functionalities out of the box.

  - ### Smart contracts: Sophia
    æternity smart contract programming is unique: Sophia is a typed functional programming language in the ML family that makes it easier to write correct programs.

  - ### FATE Virtual Machine: faster, simpler, safer code
    The Fast æternity Transaction Engine, or FATE VM, uses a higher level of abstraction and automatically minimizes error with type checking, delivering a simpler, easier, safer programming environment.

  - ### Advanced State Channels Technology
    Unlike most blockchains, æternity’s core protocol was re-engineered specifically so it can accommodate state channels on a protocol level, making it easier to build applications for global-scale enterprise use cases

  - ### Naming system
    The æternity Naming System (AENS) employs safe human-readable names in place of the current system of long hashes used in blockchain transactions, reducing room for error for users.

## State Channels

State channels make it possible to execute smart contracts off-chain. The blockchain enforces the 
smart contract code, only in the case of a disagreement between the contracting parties.

## Safe Smart Contracts with Sophia
Sophia is a functional Smart Contract language in the ML family. It is strongly-typed and has a restricted mutable state. Sophia is a Ocaml-like language with syntax mostly resembling that of Reason.

### What is Sophia?
![](./img/Sophia_Icon.svg) The Sophia language was created to easily utilize the potentials of the æternity protocol. Some features of conventional languages, such as floating point arithmetics for example, are not present, while some blockchain-specific primitives, constructions, and types have been added.

## Hundreds of Contributors, Friends and Partners

Founded by Yanislav Malahov, the community has been grown to hundreds of contributors 
and thousands of people all over the world. Having exchanged ideas and pursued blockchain endeavors with many of the greatest minds, 
Yanislav is a true veteran of the blockchain space. Back in 2013, the "godfather of ethereum" 
envisioned powerful algorithms on blockchains. Now, with æternity, a new version of his vision is becoming reality once more.
