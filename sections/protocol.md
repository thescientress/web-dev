                            The æternity protocol is capable of supporting anything that first-generation Smart Contract platforms can. And more. It can power <b>Games, Payments, Identity, Decentralized Finance, Registries, Token-Economies, Supply Chains and more</b>. Many of its applications have not been discovered yet. <b>The future is yours.</b>

                            æternity is built with security in mind. The reference implementation is written in Erlang, following all standards of high-quality software engineering. Recurring security audits and intensive property-based testing are part of the protocol developers' daily work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The æternity protocol interacts with a type-safe VM called the Fast æternity Transaction Engine (FATE), engineered to boost efficiency (gas consumption) and security (type-safe). Together with Sophia, a functional smart contract language that supports formal verification, the æternity protocol provides a unique take on blockchain and smart contract security.

                        <p>
                            To scale to billions of users and transactions, the æternity protocol provides trustless off-chain scaling with <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/channels/README.md">State Channels</a> technology. Without compromising on security, State Channels allow peer-to-peer transactions and Smart Contract execution off-chain. Channels can be opened and closed in parallel, enabling unlimited scalability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            æternity's consensus protocol - <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/128ef275ae8ed956d62eedb240b64c26b714ce85/consensus/bitcoin-ng.md">Bitcoin-NG</a> - is fast. With on-chain speeds reaching 120tx/s, æternity is about 8 times faster than Ethereum and about 15 times faster than Bitcoin. Block confirmation times are as low as 3 seconds, which significantly improves the user experience.

                    <h3>Efficient low-to-no fees</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            æternity is equipped with dozens of native transaction types for managing <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/channels/README.md">State Channels</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/oracles/oracles.md">Oracles</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/AENS.md">Names</a>, among others. They are all optimized in terms of gas costs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, transactions and Smart Contract executions in State Channels don't incur any fees. On-chain, <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/128ef275ae8ed956d62eedb240b64c26b714ce85/consensus/bitcoin-ng.md">Bitcoin-NG</a> — the protocol's consensus mechanism, allows for more transactions and smart contract executions per block in comparison to other platforms. This relaxes the fee and gas markets and leads to lower costs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since all Smart Contracts are executed in the highly efficient <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/e2940192379916fb21a053b3ab09d1dff2ac76ef/contracts/fate.md">FATE VM</a>, less gas is needed overall. <b>A FATE contract is only 10% of the size of an EVM contract.</b>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            On æternity, <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/oracles/oracles.md">Oracles</a> are managed by special types of transactions. They can be programmed to request and provide data from information providers and APIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a Smart Contract requires access to weather data, an Oracle request transaction—including a data schema, is broadcast on-chain. Data providers can respond to such data requests and charge a fee for the response.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oracle providers can register on-chain and start providing any type of data by charging a fee. This allows Smart Contract developers to create applications that interact with information coming from the real-world, enabling Decentralized Finance applications, among many others.

                            With Satoshi’s legacy at its core, the æternity protocol is built to be decentralized. Anyone can host a node and start mining, connect to the Mainnet, and help secure the chain by verifying transactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The æternity network is operated by a community of node operators. It is fully trustless, with no central authority, no master nodes, or kill-switches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Proof-of-Work mechanism incorporated in æternity is <a href="https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo">Cuckoo Cycle</a>. It is highly efficient and the first one to rely on graph-theoretic proofs. It is also the most memory-bound, yet with instant verification.

                        <p>
                            æternity uses the accounts model which makes all transactions public by default. With the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/generalized_accounts/generalized_accounts.md">Generalized Accounts</a>, a unique technological feature, it is possible to sign transactions with a very high degree of flexibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From a cryptographic point of view, the protocol uses Blake2b (256 bits digest) and ed25519. It also supports Schnorr Signatures. Communication between nodes is encrypted with the Noise Protocol. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Off-chain State Channels transactions and smart contract executions are fully private unless published on-chain.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is trivial to set up a private blockchain network based on the æternity protocol for enterprise or governmental use.
